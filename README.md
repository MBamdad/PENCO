# Physics-Informed Multi-Head Neural Operator (PI-MHNO)
The Physics-Informed Multi-Head Neural Operator is a novel deep learning architecture that solves two key problems in simulating physical systems. First, its multi-head design predicts the entire time evolution in a single pass, which prevents the compounding errors common in recurrent models. Second, it integrates governing physical equations directly into its training, making it more accurate, data efficient, and physically consistent.
